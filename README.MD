PyWordle
===============

Why another implementation for wordle, isn't the main hype over already? Aren't there a lot of implementations and websites to play the game?

Yes, but I was bored.

Uses the word list from [cfreshman](https://gist.github.com/cfreshman/a03ef2cba789d8cf00c08f767e0fad7b) for the words.

Start by running
```
python3 main.py
```
